 <p>A picture created from simple shapes based off of my partner Z's description of an object!</p> 
 <p>I had to guess what his object off of his really vauge description of a stuffed animal.</p> 
 <p>I thought it was a huge and tall one, but .... it was a pretty medium sized stuffed bear. </p> 
 <p>heh oops!</p>
