 <p><b>MY OPTICAL ILLUSION </b> </p>

     <p> Although this is a quick and simple anaglyph illusion I think this is one of my favorite illuisons I've seen.
    </p>   
      <p> " I might be a bit biased. " </p>  
      <p>The anaglyph illusion was inspired by 3D glasses and I wanted to create an effect that would</p> 
      <p>cause the person looking at this confusion forcing them to really look at it. </p>
